Data Aquisition:

	My data is mainly source via an API provided by the website AlphaVantage. I explored the options of using GoogleTrends data as well as Twitter data to complement that, but ended up deciding that it was not a good option for the scope of this project. You can see my Data Gathering process in the DataGathering notebook in the Data Gathering folder.

Data Transformation:
	
	Due to it's nature (purely numeric) there was not a huge need for complex transformations or feature engineering, rather the difficulties were in dealing with the timeseries nature. Although with that said, my data does get scaled before being passed into the Neural Net used.
