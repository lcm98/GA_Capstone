# Progress Report

### Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?

Yup

### Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?

I have, being Time Series data from an API the data itself is pretty straightforward.

### Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?

I created a very basic Time Series ARMA model just to see what it looked like. Stock data lived up to it's expectation of being hard to predict. The model was absolutely terrible, throwing darts at a board would be better than the simple model I made. That said though, it was completely expected, and simply emphasizes the point that I need to make sure I can incorporate good indicators.

### What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?

The blocker I face is the modeling. I am unused to working with Time Series data so I don't know the ins and outs of the process. I really just need to dive in to understand how it works to better be able to add in indicators that will hopefully better predict.

### Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?

Yup

### What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?

Now that Project 4 and my little side project is out of the way I can focus on the capstone much more intently. I need to expand my models beyond using ARMA, and add in the indicator data I have. I would *like* to have the time to keep reading up on the Stock Market to keep gaining a deeper understanding of what good directions to move in could be.

### What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?

As someone who's never really touched the financial area, any insight of directions you think I should take the project are welcome. Additionally any tips or tricks about working with Time Series data since it's something we breezed by in class.
